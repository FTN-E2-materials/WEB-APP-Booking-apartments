## Non-functional requirements and notes

● Administrators are programmatically loaded from a text file and cannot be retrieved later
add. Hosts can only be created by Administrators.

● All data changes must be saved in a file immediately after the operation is performed

● Functionality is available to a user type only if there is a described functionality for that
user type

● Deletion is logical.

● If invalid arguments are sent from the client, there must be a response

  ○ Status 400 Bad Request

  ○ Error message in the body (HTML with error for JSP / Servlet, JSON for everything else)

● If a client tries to access a resource for which it does not have permission, it must have an answer

  ○ Status 403 Forbidden
  
  ○ Example: A guest tries to access a page to add the contents of an apartment that
    is the sole responsibility of the administrator.
    
● The examples in Figures 1-3 are given as a guide, your application is not expected to have
identical, but not a similar look - the style is left to you

● *** Depending on the specific implementation, students can arbitrarily
expand given entities or add others. ***
